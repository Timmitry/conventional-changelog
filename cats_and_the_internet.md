Images and videos of [domestic cats](Cat "wikilink") make up some of the
most viewed content on the [web](World_Wide_Web "wikilink"),
particularly [image macros](image_macro "wikilink") in the form of
[lolcats](lolcat "wikilink").
[ThoughtCatalog](Thought_Catalog "wikilink") has described cats as the
"unofficial mascot of the Internet".[1]

The subject has attracted the attention of various scholars and critics,
who have analysed why this form of [low art](low_culture "wikilink") has
reached iconic status. Although it may be considered frivolous,
cat-related Internet content contributes to how people interact with
media and culture.[2] Some argue that there is a depth and complexity to
this seemingly simple content, with a suggestion that the [positive
psychological effects that pets have on their
owners](Animal-assisted_therapy "wikilink") also hold true for cat
images viewed online.[3]

Research has suggested that viewing online cat media is related to
positive emotions, and that it even may work as a form of digital
therapy or stress relief for some users. Some elements of research also
shows that feelings of guilt when postponing tasks can be reduced by
viewing cat content.[4]

Some individual cats, such as [Grumpy Cat](Grumpy_Cat "wikilink") and
[Lil Bub](Lil_Bub "wikilink"), have achieved popularity online because
of their unusual appearances and funny cat videos.
